1) So here we are going to take a look at all the components inside a cookbook:
2) So lets first go ahead and create a sample cookbook inside a directory named as "cookbooks".
3) We will use below command in order to create the cookbooks in chef
    # chef generate cookbook cookbooks/workstation
    Notice that here in this perticular cookbook we are going to crate a same scerario as that of setup cookbook
    we have created under local_recipes.
    so this chef generate command will create the required cookbook and if we change directory to cookbooks/workstation
    then we can see all the components of this cookbook
4) Now after generating the cookbook we can see the entire structure of a cookbook using tree command as below
    # tree cookbooks
    output

            └── default_test.rb

7 directories, 8 files
5) So above tree command has given us the complete components pucture of the cookbook workstation
6) Lets go one by one over some of the important components over here.
    a) Berksfile
        This berksfile is used to handle dependencies for our cookbook, and we will see its use when we will work 
        with chefserver
    b) chefignore
        This is very similar to the .gitignore file which we use to remove some files or directory from git tracking 
        system. So here in chefignore file is used to mention the file which we don't want to upload to the chef server
        when uploading the cookbook to the chef server.
    c) spec and test
        These are the directories related to testing the cookbooks locally on the worstation. these are used to develop
        test driven approach.
        spec directory : This is for unit testing using common unit testing framework of ruby called as rspec. this 
                            rspec can be used to test functionality of small pieces of our code 
        test directory : This is used for integration tesin. This uses the framework called as test kitchen
        Notice that these directories are uploaded to the chef server when we upload cookbook to the chefserver. and these
        are by default added into the chefignore file.
    d) metadata.rb file 
        This file contain the common information like, version of the cookbook, the maintainer of the cookbook etc
        We can also store dependencies inside the metadata file. for example one cookbook can call another cookbook
        inside of it and these can be considered as a library. So we mention here the dependencies and we will look
        the use of it later
    e) README.md file
        this is a markdown file used to have description of this cookbook.
    f) recipes folder
        This is the place where all our recipes are stored. and by default when we create the cookbook we get this
        recipe named as default.rb
7) Now lets go ahead and add our first recipe inside our cookbook under recipe folder and since we want to mirror the 
    same concept as that of setup.rb, so we will create similar recipe to that of setup.rb inside the cookbook now
        # chef generate recipe cookbooks/workstation setup
        we can use this above command in order to have our cookbook created by the chef itself.
8) again we can check with the tree command that our cookbook have been saved under recipe folder
