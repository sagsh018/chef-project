1) So here we are going to include the searching capabilities on the chef server in the recipe itself
2) with the help of technique we are going to build the dynamic load-balancer
3) go through the myhaproxy default recipe and try to understand how we have replaced the harcoded values of
    webserver with the dynamically generated array of servers along with there IP address.
4) Once we have updated the default.rb recipe of myhaproxy cookbook and replaced the hardcoded values with the 
    dynamically generated array of servers based on the search() method call on INDEX=> node and SEARCH=> "role:web"
5) after updating the cookbook, we will update the version of the cookbook as well to 1.0.0, then upload the 
    cookbook to chef server using berks upload
    # cd cookbooks/myhaproxy/
    # berks upload
    # vagrant ssh load-balancer
    # sudo chef-client
6) Then you can check whether the newest verson of the cookbook is applied or not
    # knife node show load-balancer -a cookbooks
7)
