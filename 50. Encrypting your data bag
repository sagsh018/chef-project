1) So till now we have seen the use of a data bag.
2) Now we will see how to encrypt the data stored inside the data bag with the help of secret key
# cd ~/chef-repo
# knife data bag list
    groups
    users
3) Now we will generate the secret key with the help of below openssl command and place it under our chef-repo 
    only/
    # openssl rand -base64 512 | tr -d '\r\n' > secret-key
    # ls 
            secret-key
4) Now we can create new data bag named as secret-users with the help of this secret-key generated using below command
    # knife data bag create secret-users --secret-file secret-key
        Created data_bag[secret-users]
    # knife data bag list   
        groups
        secret-users
        users
5) Now we will update data to this secret-users data bag fromone of our users jsin file named julia.json.
    # knife data bag from file secret-users data_bags/users/julia.json --secret-file secret-key
         Updated data_bag_item[secret-users::julia]
6) Now we can check out the data inside the data bag secret-user and you will find it encrypted
    # knife data bag show secret-users julia
        This will show the data inside the data bag secret-users as encrypted
7) if you want to decrypt the data and then show then use the show command alsong with secret key.
    # knife data bag show secret-users julia --secret-file secret-key

8) So till now we have just encrypted the data using the personal key which we have created. but we can actually
    make use of the client.pem key which is distributed to the node at the time of bootstrapping
    from the chef server,
    see the required commands to explore later on this,:

    # vagrant ssh web1
    # ls /etc/chef/
        This will give is the .pem file which we can use to encrypt the data inside the data bag.
    # exit
    # knife vault --help  ==> help us in encryption of data using .pem key
