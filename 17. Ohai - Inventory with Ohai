1) There are some cases where you need to know the information related to the internal system properties of the 
    noe on which you want to run your recipe or cookbook
2) In this section we are going to talk about the Ohai, which is system descovery tool and it is used to get
    more information about the node that actually running our code.
3) So in this section we will talk about how Ohai run, and what its purposes, how it does the system inventory. We
    will then talk about the node object, which actually takes this information gathered from running the system
    inventory and makes it available to us inside our recipe.
    We will able to get the host specific details like IP address, host name, the speed of the node running the code
    or may be the amount of memory available to it.
4) We will then talk about how we can access these node details inside of our recipes and have short discussion
    about ruby string interpolation
    atthe end of this section we will be actually access the node object inside of our own recipe and use that same 
    information to build our index.html web page
