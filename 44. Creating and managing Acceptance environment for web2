1) So as per previous section we have added both web1 and load-balancer node to the environment named production
2) This production environment has cook restrictions as well.
3) In this section we are going to create another environment named as Acceptance environment which will not have
    any restriction of cookbooks. This will be a king of testing environment for our new code that we will 
    develop

# vi environments/acceptance.rb
    ==============================================
    name "acceptance"
    description "This is where our test code runs"
    ================================================
# knife environment list
    _default
    acceptance
    production
# knife environment show acceptance
    chef_type:           environment
    cookbook_versions:
    default_attributes:
    description:         This is where our test code runs
    json_class:          Chef::Environment
    name:                acceptance
    override_attributes:
# knife node environment set web2 acceptance
# knife node show web2
    Node Name:   web2
    Environment: acceptance
# vagrant ssh web2
# sudo chef-client

Important Note :: We could also assign environment to node while bootstrapping it. by using option -E in 
                    bootstrapping command.
