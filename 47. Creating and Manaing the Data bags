1) So in this section of the course we are actually going to create and manage the data bags on our chef server
2) common use cases for data bags :
    a) list of common users who want access to certain set of servers,
3) So in our case, we want to be able to dynamically able to add and remove the users and groups on any perticular
    node that should have them. So for this we are going to make use of Data bags
4) A data bags is going to be a custom container what will be filled with some basic JSON data that might live on
    your chef server.
5) Since data bags are index by chef server, we can search through these data bags from within the recipe and the
    data down and do something with it.
6) So lets create the data bag locally first under the directory named as data_bag at the same level of roles
    and environments
    # cd /c/Users/Sagar/projects/chef/chef-repo
    # mkdir -p data_bags
7) We can all sorts of commands similar to what we have used in case of nodes, roles and environment. for example:
    # knife data bag --help ==> this will give all sorts of option available.
    # knife data bag list ==> As of now nothing will be returned as no data bag is created yet.
8) So lets first create the data bag on our chef server.
    # knife data bag create users
        Created data_bag[users]
    So this has created data bag on our chef server
    # knife data bag list
        o/p: users
    So this time we are getting some output.
9) So now we are ready to upload data to this data bag on chef server and for that we have to create some custom
    JSON file on our local machine and that we will upload to this data bag on chef server.
    # vi data_bags/user1.json
        {
            "id": "user1",
            "comment": "I am user 1",
            "uid": "5001",
            "gid": "5001",
            "home": "/home/user1",
            "shell": "/bin/bash",
            "platform": "centos"
        }
    # vi data_bags/user2.json
        {
            "id": "user2",
            "comment": "I am user 2",
            "uid": "5002",
            "gid": "5000",
            "home": "/home/user2",
            "shell": "/bin/bash",
            "platform": "centos"
        }
    So if you observe at the end of above json files we have mentioned the platforms, which means all the platform  
    which are centos should have this user.
10) Now lets go ahead and upload these data bag json items to our data bag on chef server named as "users"
    # knife data bag from file users data_bags/user1.json data_bags/user2.json
        Updated data_bag_item[users::user1]
        Updated data_bag_item[users::user2]
    # knife data bag list
        users
    # knife data bag show users
        user1
        user2
    # knife data bag show users/user1
        comment
        gid
        home
        id
        platform
        shell
        uid
    So this has shown what all information does this data bag contain for user1
11) So once this data bag is created and uplodaed to chef server we now have one more index to search into.
    # knife search users "*:*"
        chef_type: data_bag_item
        comment:   I am user 2
        data_bag:  users
        gid:       5000
        home:      /home/user2
        id:        user2
        platform:  centos
        shell:     /bin/bash
        uid:       5002

        chef_type: data_bag_item
        comment:   I am user 1
        data_bag:  users
        gid:       5000
        home:      /home/user1
        id:        user1
        platform:  centos
        shell:     /bin/bash
        uid:       5001
    So this search has displayed both my users.
    # knife search users "id:user1"
        chef_type: data_bag_item
        comment:   I am user 1
        data_bag:  users
        gid:       5000
        home:      /home/user1
        id:        user1
        platform:  centos
        shell:     /bin/bash
        uid:       5001
    # knife search users "id:user1" -a uid
          uid: 5001
    So this is how we can perform the searches based on the index data bag and search patterns.

12) Now till now we have created the data bags for users only. let say we want to create the data bag for groups
    to which the users can be added as well.
    So again lets create another directory under data_bags named as groups 
    # mkdir -p data_bags/groups
14) Now lets go and create another data bag along with users on chef server as well named as groups
    # knife data bag create groups
        Created data_bag[groups]
15) And now lets write the json data into our groups files to upload the data to groups data bag on chef server,
    # vi code data_bags/groups/group1.json
        {
            "id": "5000",
            "gid": "5000",
            "members": ["user1", "user2"]
        }
16) Now we can uploade this data to groups data bag on chef server
    # knife data bag from file groups data_bags/groups/group1.json
        Updated data_bag_item[groups::5000]
    # knife data bag list
        groups
        users
    # knife data bag show groups
        5000
    # knife data bag show groups/5000
        gid
        id
        members
17) So till now we have created two data bags, named users and groups onto our chef server and performed some
    search on them.
18) We can have a look at the data bags created on our chef manage as well under policy section
