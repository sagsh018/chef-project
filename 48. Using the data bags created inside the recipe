1) So till now we have created the data bags and uploaded them to chef server.
2) These newly created data bags on chef server provided us the new search index to search through from our 
    recipe and make use of the data present inside our data bag container.
3) So in this section we are going to create a brand new cookbook named as "myusers"
    # pwd => /c/Users/Sagar/projects/chef/chef-repo
    # chef generate cookbook cookbooks/myusers
    # vi cookbooks/myusers/recipes/default.rb
        Look at the default recipe to have a better idea on how the data inside data bag is used in the recipe.
        ======================================================
        search("users", "platform:centos").each do |user_data|
            user user_data['id'] do
                comment user_data['comment']
                uid user_data['uid']
                gid user_data['gid']
                home user_data['home']
                shell user_data['shell']
            end
        end
        =======================================================
        So here we have used the search inside our recipe and on each search value for platform centos we have 
        looped in and created a new user based on the data coming out of the data bag.
4) Next this to do is that to add the newly created cookbook to the role "web" to make sure that all of my webservers
    should have these set of users created beforehand.
    # vi roles/web.rb
        run_list "recipe[myusers]","recipe[workstation]","recipe[webserver]"
    added the new cookbook to runlist of role web
    and save it.
5) Now we have two things that need to be uploaded to chef server, 
    a) our new cookbook myusers
    b) our modified role web.
6) Lets update our cookbook and role to chef server now.
    # cd cookbooks/myusers
    # berks install
    # berks upload 
    # cd ../..
    # knife role from file roles/web.rb
7) Now after uploading everything to chef server we are now ready to converge our web server with the newly 
    created cookbook.
    # vagrant ssh web1
    # sudo chef-client
    cheking in the system web1
    # tail /etc/passwd
        user2:x:5002:1:I am user 2:/home/user2:/bin/bash
        user1:x:1234:1:test user 1:/home/user1:/bin/bash
