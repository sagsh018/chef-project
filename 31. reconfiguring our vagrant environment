1) So now that we have chef hosted chef server ready with us and we have downloaded the required creds and keys
    along with chef starter-kit to talk to chef server and also uploaded our cookbooks to chef server.
2) Its now time to setup our new environment using the vagrant VM's
    Environment :
    a) Web server 1
    b) Web server 2
    c) Load Balancer
    So in total we have to spin up three new nodes, two web server nodes which we are going to configure with the 
    help of chef and one load balancer which is going to distribute the load between these two web server nodes.
3) So lets go ahead and take the backup of our orginal vagrant file and replace it with the new configuration
    # cp -p Vagrantfile bkp.Vagrantfile.`date +%F`
    and replcae the old vagrantfile with the new one downloaded from course.
    chef out the new vagrant file having configuration for web1, web2 and loadbalancer nodes.
