1) The Chef Infra Server acts as a hub for configuration data. The Chef Infra Server stores cookbooks, 
    the policies that are applied to nodes, and metadata that describes each registered node that is being 
    managed by Chef Infra Client. Nodes use Chef Infra Client to ask the Chef Infra Server for configuration 
    details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. 
2)  Chef Infra Client then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves 
    (and not on the Chef Infra Server).
3) The front end of chef server is now writtne in Erlang programming language and thats why is now also called
    Erchef.
4) The Chef Infra Server can be configured via the /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb file. Whenever this file is 
    modified, the chef-server-ctl reconfigure command must be run to apply the changes
5) Now chef server is can be configured with three approaches :
    a) Normal approache, where the cookbooks reside on the chef server itself
    b) Approach where the cookbooks are stored externally on AWS S3
    c) Approach where the cookbooks are stored externally on PostgreSQL database.
6) In this course we are going to concentrate only on the approach where cookbooks are going to be kept on the 
    chef server only.
7) Chef server components:
    a) Clients :: Nodes, cookbook authors, Chef manage users
    b) Load Balancer :: Nginx is used as fron end load Balancer
    c) Chef Manage :: Web UI for chef server
    d) Chef server :: The place to hold all you cookbooks, there metadata, policies and all
    e) Bookshelf :: Bookshelf is used to store cookbook content—files, templates, and so on—that have been uploaded
         to the Chef Infra Server as part of a cookbook version.
          If two different cookbooks or different versions of the same cookbook include the same file or template, 
          Bookshelf will store that file only once
    f) messages :: chef-elasticsearch wraps Elastisearch and exposes its REST API for indexing and search. 
        All messages are added to a dedicated search index repository.
    g) PostgreSQL :: PostgreSQL is the data storage repository for the Chef Infra Server

Installation of Chef Server
============================
There are three configuration scenarios for the Chef Infra Server:

a) Standalone (everything on a single machine)
b) High availability (machines configured for front-end and back-end, allowing for failover on the back-end and 
    load-balancing on the front-end, as required)
c) Tiered (machines configured for front-end and back-end, with a single back-end and load-balancing on the 
    front-end, as required)
In this course we will proceed with standalone installation of chef server 

Steps
======
1) Download the package from https://downloads.chef.io/chef-server/
2) once downloaded sent it to chefserver vagrant machine
    # scp -p chef-server-core-12.17.33-1.el7.x86_64.rpm vagrant@192.168.10.21:/tmp
3) # cd /tmp
    # rpm -Uvh chef-server-core-12.17.33-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
4) then we have to configure the chef server by using below command
    # chef-server-ctl reconfigure
5) Then lets create the user(administrator) with the help of below command in order to manage the chef server
    # chef-server-ctl user-create sharmasag018 Sagar Sharma sharmasag018@outlook.com 'Ishwarusmay19922005' --filename /home/sharmasag018/sagar.pem
    # chef-server-ctl user-show
6) Then lets create the organization 
    # chef-server-ctl org-create skylights 'Sky Lights, Inc.' --association_user sharmasag018 --filename /home/sharmasag018/skylight-validator.pem
    # chef-server-ctl org-show
7) Now lets install chef-manage in order to access the chef server from web console
    # chef-server-ctl install chef-manage
    then
    # chef-server-ctl reconfigure
    then 
    # chef-manage-ctl reconfigure
        # press any key
        # then enter and press end
        # then q and type yes and enter
        This is how you will accept the license.
        and chef manage will be reconfigured.
8) Finally you can access the chef server using below IP
    192.168.10.21
    from browser and you will see what we have configured called chef-manage.
9) Now on Chef-Manage UI >> Administration >> choose organization >> click on starter kit in left pane >> 
    Download starter kit >> agree to reset the old keys
10) unzip the downloaded chef-starter >> copy the chef-repo from inside of it and put it under our chef project 
    directory :: /c/Users/Sagar/projects/chef
    and then move the cookbooks directory we have created till now to theis chef-repo folder
    So now all our cookbooks reside inside the :: /c/Users/Sagar/projects/chef/chef-repo/cookbooks
11) Now once the starter-kit has been downloaded from the chefserver Web UI and kept inside our chef project
    working directory, we can now access the chef server using knife command from our local windows
    workstation.
    for now we can test this using below commands
    # knife node list 
    This will give an error due to ssl certificate so we can run first below command
    # knife ssl fetch
    then finally run
    # knife node list
    This will note give any output as of now as we haven't bootstrapped any node yet.
    

Using Chef hosted chef server
===============================
1) URL ==> https://manage.chef.io/signup
    Full Name : Sagar Sharma
    Company : skylights
    email : sharmasag018@outlook.com
    Username : sharmasag018
    check the license agreement and click on continue
    verify the account from email sent on above email ID 
    Then on the next page give the password for your chef hosted account
    password : same as that of default.
    click on create user
    This will create your chef hosted account
2) Once you create your chef hosted account as above and login to the chef manage page hosted by chef with your
    creds, it is going to welcome you with the page to create your organization
    => click on create organization >> provide full name (Sky Lights, Inc.) and short name (skylights) for your
        organization >> click on create organization
3) Once that is done, chef manage will then show you the next page of administration from where you can again
    download the starter kit for your organization and place it under our chef project working directory and
    copy our cookbook folder into the the chef-repo folder created after unzipping that started kit.
4) Our URL to login to our organization on chef server :: https://api.chef.io/organizations/skylights
