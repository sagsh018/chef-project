Unit Testing OR Chefspec
=========================
1) Unlike of integration testing we did in previous lecture here are not insterested on actually installing the chef code on the Virtual 
    environment and perform the tests.
2) Here we are more interested on how the chef code has been written and see if it is written properly or not. We do this with the help of what 
    is called resource collection 
3) Whenever we run the chef-client, it collect all the reources and load them into memory in order to apply them on the node at the time of
    converge.
4) This collection of resources that are loaded into memory for convergance is called as resource collection
5) ChefSpec is an extension of RSpec, which is nothing but a "Behaviour Driven development (BDD) framework of ruby.
6) To run ChefSpec we run:
    # chef exec rspec
7) Documentation for chefspec => https://docs.chef.io/workstation/chefspec/
8) To have a llok at how to write the tests => https://github.com/chefspec/chefspec
We will continue this later.
