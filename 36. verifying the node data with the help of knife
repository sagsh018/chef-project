# knife node list
# knife cookbook list
for details of any perticular cookbook we could use
# knife cookbook show myhaproxy
    myhaproxy   0.1.3  0.1.2  0.1.1  0.1.0
    So it has given me all the versions available on chef server for this perticular cookbook
    now suppose
    # knife cookbook show myhaproxy 0.1.3
    This will given even more information for this perticular version of cookbook with the help of metadata updated 
    for this cookbook to chef server.

Similarly to get the details about the node we could use 
# knife node show web1
Also if we want to see the attributes for the node let say web1
# knife node show web1 -a ipaddress
# knife node show web1 -a hostname
# knife node show web1 -a node
    Now this last one is going to list all the attributes stored inside the chef server as the node object of this 
    perticular node web1. Notice these attributes are collected during the last successful chef-client run on
    web1 and then are stored inside the chef server as a node object.
    and from chef server we have asked using the knife command as above


We could even list the sub attributes by passsing them in the above command using the dots
# knife node show web1 -a memory
# knife node show web1 -a memory.total
# knife node show web1 -a cpu
# knife node show web1 -a cpu.0.mhz

So all this information about the attributes of node can be usefull and can be gathered from the chef server
using knife command.

Also we could see what all cookbooks are deployed on my node like there versions and all with the special
node attribute called cookbook
# knife node show load-balancer -a cookbooks
