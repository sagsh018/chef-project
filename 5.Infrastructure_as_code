1) Chef describes infrastructure as code. IAC means writing code to manage configurations and automate provisioning of
    infrastrucure in addition to deployments.
2) In this course we are going to learn three differnet parts of Chef
    a) Chef DK-- Chef development kit, which is going to write scripts/code to automate your infrastructure and 
        test yhem locally as well with the help of integration testing, etc. and then finally upload the code to    
        chef server
    b) node -- it is a physical of virtual machine which is managed by chef, "chef-client" euns on each server and
        securely communicate with chef server. chef-client follow the instructions which we give in a form of recipies
        or for now lets call the code books, to bring the node into the desired state.
    c) chef-server -- this is going to act as a central artifact repo for all the information in code which we use to 
        provision these infrastructure nodes.
