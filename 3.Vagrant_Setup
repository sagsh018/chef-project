So here we are going to setup vagrant setup to create our lab.
You can go ahead with the document present at same location on gitHub repo with the name "vbox_&_vagrant_installation.pdf"
to install virtual box and vagrant using chocolatey installer.
once the installation is done, check the version of the tools using below commands
1) vboxmanage --version // To check virtual box version
2) vagrant --version // To check vagrant version
Also add vagrant and vboxmanage in youe system variable path using below commands
Virtual box
============
PS> $path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(“PATH”, “Machine”)
PS> $vbox_path = “C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox”
PS> [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(“PATH”, “$path;$vbox_path”, “Machine”)

vagrant
=======
PS> $path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(“PATH”, “Machine”)
PS> $vagrant_path = “C:\HashiCorp\Vagrant\bin”
PS> [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(“PATH”, “$path;$vagrant_path”, “Machine”)

OR 

You can open system variable path in windows and add the path manually.

Now once this setup is done, we can now go agead and spin uo our virtual machines using "Vagrantfile" present in
same location on gitHub repo. This will spin up 3 VM's with chef project "bento/centos-7.2"
The "vagrantfile" will spin up the complete environment, but to lear below are the command to follow to spin up environmwnt 
step by step.

1) move into the chef directory under projects
2) # vagrant box add bento/centos-7.2 --provider=virtualbox
    This will provide us with basic centos 7.2 box to manage.
3) # vagrant init bento/centos-7.2
    This will initiate a process and create a "vagrantfile" which we were talking above and initiate a centos machine.
4) It is this vagrantfile which is used by vagrnat user to manage our boxes and it is written in Ruby.
5) once this is done we can launch our box using this Vagrantfile wherever we want, provided this vagrantfile,
    shoudl be present in that perticular directory.
6) so once this Vagrantfile present in perticular directory, we can use below command to bring up the vertual machines
    # vagrnat up
7) Then you can login to a vagrant VM using "vagrant ssh <VM name>"
8) once you are logged in we can then install chef DK in that local VM for first part of our course using below command
    # curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P chefdk -c stable -v 0.18.30
9) Then you install perticular editor like vim
    # yum install vim -y
