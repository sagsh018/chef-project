1) So till now we have logged into the node machine like web1, web2, load-balancer in order to run the chef-client
2) Now we will try to under stand the commmand that we can run on our workstation and without logging into our
    nodes we can run chef-client/or any other command on the node.
3) below is the command 
    # knife ssh localhost "sudo chef-client" --manual-list --ssh-port 2222 --ssh-user vagrant --ssh-identity-file 
        /c/Users/Sagar/projects/chef/.vagrant/machines/web1/virtualbox/private_key
    So with this command we could run any command on the remote nodes with the help of knife ssh command.
4) If we notice the knife ssh command we have used above,
    we  could also provide the search pattern to this command and it will go and search the required on the 
    chef server and then run the chef-client against that
    but this is possible in more production like environment where we have all the servers are runnon on the 
    same port as 22 instead of our case where all the vagrant VM's are running with different ports 
5) Example of some such commands
    # knife ssh "*:*" -x chef -P chef "sudo chef-client"
        here all the nodes will be converged in one go
    # knife ssh "role:web" -x chef -P chef "sudo chef-client"
        so all the nodes with the role named : web, will be converged in one go.
    # knife ssh "name:web1" -x chef -P chef "sudo chef-client"
        here only one node named : web1 will be converged.
    So if we notice in the above commands we are passing the searching regular expression in the command and 
    followed by that we are giving the username and password and followed by that we are also giving the command
    to be run for the item we are searching.
