1) So till now we have learnt about the file resource that we used to upadate the file inside the server and keep it
    up to date.
2) but suppose if we want to create a file of 1000 of lines then using the content attribute of file resource would
    make the recipe grow out of size.
3) The solution to above issue is to make use of the template resource. template resources are actually much more 
    mature way to handle files that exist on the node.
4) We can use templates to write configuration files, or even something like index.html files as well
5) So here in this section we are going to discuss how to actually generate the file on the node using the template 
    resource.
6) We will talk about the embedded ruby with which the template files are written and also access try to access one of
    the node attributes in one of these templating files.
