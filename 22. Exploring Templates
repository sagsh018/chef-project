1) Here we are going to check out "why to use Templates"
2) Lets discuss some of the limitations which we have came accross in writing the chef cookbooks in the way we have
    written them so far.
3) Lets consider the file resource:
    a) Inside our server.rb file we tried to insert some of the node attributes inside the html tags to have our    
        index.html created to serve our web page. But this is a very simple Hello World page. What if we have real 
        web application
    b) If we consider the actual web application , we can't write the entire HTML code inside the content attribute
        of file in our recipe, because we will run into all sorts of isseu because of this for example:
        i) "<h1 style="color: red;">Hello World</h1>"
            now if you notice in the above statement, we have started the statement with the double quotes as thi is
            the part of content inside the file resoure, but because of the CSS style tag we have to include another
            double quote and which will ultimately close the opening quote of the content attribute.
        ii) Also if try to copy the large HTML code inside the content of a fle resource then it could alos lead to
            lot of issues, similarly if you try to clean up your recipe, due to any thing missing in the complex 
            recipe, it could lead to the corrupted recipe
    c) So what do we need to overcome these issues:
        We need the ability to store the data that we would like to deploy into another file, and that file will
        be in its native format but still allow us to insert ruby code. Specially, the node attributes we have defined.
        Then we can tell chef to reference that file which contains my HTML code rather than pasting it into the recipe. 
        Hence it will result into more cleaner recipe at the end.
    d) But we have one issue in the above approach, the issue is that we try to import these node attributes into our
        index.html file so how can i reference a static HTML file and actually insert node attributes to that static
        index.html file which we will ask chef to reference 
    e) So the challange here is that keep the static content of the file into a separate file in its native format,
        but at the same time, insert node attributes and variables into this file. The solution to this is a 
        Template resource.
4) A Template resource is an Embedded Ruby (ERB) template that is used to generate files for us. These templates are 
    going to be the great ways to insert ruby expressions and statements into a native file format.
    The idea being, this will allow me to actually insert these node attributes that i have defined into a HTML file
    which will be referenced by our recipe.
5) So basically using the template resource will be very much like using the file resource, but instead of putting all 
    the content of that file into the recipe i am instead going to put my native file format into an ERB file.
    This ERB file will allow me to insert ruby expressions and statements that the compiler will resolve. The template
    resoure will then move resulting file into the proper location on disk, after resolving the node attributes and
    variables that we have defined 
6) So to use the template two things you must have 
    i) Add a template resource to our recipe. This will replace the file resource that we were using uptill now.
    ii) An Embedded Ruby(ERB) template must be added to our cookbook. This ERB file will be mostly have HTML code in 
        our case. However it could be any native file format
        And once we define this ERB file, we will then insert our ruby code(node attributes in this case) into specifically
        formatted tags called ERB tags
