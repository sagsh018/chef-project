1) So here we are going to see how to pass entire cookbook instead of just the single recipe to the chef-client and 
    have it run multiple recipes
2) Also we wil see how to run multiple cookbooks 
3) So here we are going to make use of the below runlist syntax to select the recipe inside the webserver cookbook
    # pwd ==> /vagrant
    # sudo chef-client -z --runlist "webserver::server"
    So this will check out inside my cookbooks directory and see if it could find the "server" recipe inside "webserver"
    cookbook 
4) Similarly we can even execute the setup recipe from the worksation cook book as below
    # pwd ==> /vagrant
    # sudo chef-client -z -r "workstation::setup"
5) Now suppose if we want to execute multiple recipes all at one time from different cookbooks
    we could do this by providing the list of recipies we need to run in that pertulcar specific order in which we
    give to chef-client
    see the below command
    
    # pwd ==> /vagrant
    # sudo chef-client -z -r "recipe[workstation::setup],recipe[webserver::server]"

    Notice here we are providing ordered runlist of recipes and they will execute in the same order as they are 
    mentioned in above command
