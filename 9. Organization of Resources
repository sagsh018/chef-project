1) As we have noticed few of the recipes till now and inside those recipes what we are doing is that we are grouping the 
    resources together. where these resources are fundamental building block of configuration with chef
2) Also we have noticed that we have given these recipe files to chef client to run on node (locally till now)
3) These recipes are authored using DSL named as Ruby
4) These recipes are mostly always going to be a group of resources along with the state of those resources that are 
    desired and the actions to be take in order to bring them in desirec state
5) Also note that our recipes not only can contain the resources, they can contain any ruby codes
6) You can also call recipes from other recipes
7) Notice that resources are defined top to bottom and from left to right and thats because Ruby is synchronous language 
    So these resources are executed in exact same order in which they appear inside the recipe.
8) Also notice that even when we give multiple runlist to chef-client to run, they run in exactly the same order we give 
    them to chef-client. Notice these list of recipes are called as runlists. 
9) So the important point to notice here is that chef run the recipes in the exact order we give them to chef-client and
    also it run the resources inside those recipes in a exact same order we have written them.
