1) In this lecture we are going to make use of the node object to access the system attributes which got strored inside
    the node object when ohai run everytime we run the chef-client.
2) This node object is a globally available object, accessible to any of our recipes and any of the resources inside 
    of it
3) So now again have a look at the recipe setup.rb and check out the example for string interpolation in ruby as well
    as how we have replaced the harcoded values of the motd file resource with the node object values.
    file "/etc/motd" do
    content "This server is resource of sagar
        HOSTNAME : #{node['hostname']}
        IP ADDRESS : #{node['ipaddress']}
        CPU SPEED : #{node['cpu']['0']['mhz']}
        Total Memory : #{node['memory']['total']}
    "
    So this will print values gathered by ohai when chef-client run and print them inside my motd file
4) finally run the chef-client and the motd file will be updated with these values.
    # pwd ==> /vagrant
    # sudo chef-client -zr "recipe[workstation]"

    and motd file content will look as below

    This server is resource of sagar
    HOSTNAME : workstation
    IP ADDRESS : 10.0.2.15
    CPU SPEED : 2561.272
    Total Memory : 1016860kB
