1) So here we are going to learn about the integration/Inspec testing 
2) important links
    https://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/adding-test/ -- Regarding kitchen
    https://docs.chef.io/inspec.html -- Chef inspec tests.
    https://docs.chef.io/workstation/kitchen/ -- test kitchen
3) So first we are trying the integration testing using the vagrant as a platform to plugin
    .kitchen.yml file
    ==================
    ---
    driver:
        name: vagrant

    provisioner:
        name: chef_zero
        product_name: chef
        product_version: 13.9.4

    verifier:
        name: inspec

    platforms:
        - name: centos-7.2

    suites:
        - name: default
        run_list:
            - recipe[webserver::default]
        verifier:
            inspec_tests:
                - test/recipes
        attributes:

    default_test.rb file
    ======================
    describe service('httpd') do
        it { should be_installed }
        it { should be_running }
        it { should be_enabled }
    end

    describe port(80) do
        it { should be_listening }
    end

4) with this setup we could do first :
    a) kitchen list -- To list down the entire configuration and current stats of kitchen and last run status
    b) kitchen create -- This will provision our VM on vagrant
    c) kitchen converge -- This will deploy our cookbook on the VM
    d) kitchen verify -- This will validate the tests we are going to write under webserver/test/recipe/default_test.rb
        and this should pass the test.

Trying the integration testing with Docker installed on our system
