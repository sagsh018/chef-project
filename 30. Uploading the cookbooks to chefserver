1) Before we start uploading the cookbooks to chef server we could easily validate that whether we are able to
    connect to our chef server from out client workstation where we have our chefdk.
2) for that we could run the below knife command
    # knife client list ==> list all the available organizations available on chef server.
        o/p : skylights-validator
3) If we notice inside our directory chef-repo we have a hidden folder named as .chef and inside that we have 
    some files which are actually responsible for connection between the chefdk and chef server and those are
    a) config.rb -- This contains the configuration information about the chef server 
        current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
        log_level                :info
        log_location             STDOUT
        node_name                "sharmasag018"
        client_key               "#{current_dir}/sharmasag018.pem"
        chef_server_url          "https://chefserver/organizations/skylights"
        cookbook_path            ["#{current_dir}/../cookbooks"]
        So it basically contain the chef server URL and the .pem key file we have generated and stored inside the 
        chef server.
    b) and the key for user ID sharmasag018 on chef server, 
    we could could also mention these details such as chef server name and the path to .pem key in the
        # knife configure command
4) Now lets upload our workstation cookbook to the chef server using below commands
    # knife cookbook upload workstation   -- this is from inside of the chef-repo directory
        o/p ::
        Uploading workstation  [0.3.1]
        Uploaded 1 cookbook.
    Now lets upload the webserver cookbook as well
    # knife cookbook upload webserver 
    # knife cookbook list
5) You have to be carefull while uploading the cookbooks to the chef server because if you by chance upload the 
    cookbook with same version number again , then knife is going to override the old cookbook in the chefserver.
    thats the reason to track the changes we are changing the version of the cookbook in the metadata file.
6) now once we have uploaded the cookbooks to chef server we could actually see them in the chef manage UI on web .
7) One more thing to notice here is that our tests directories are not copied/uploaded to the chef server.
