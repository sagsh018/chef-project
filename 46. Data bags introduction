1) A data bag is a container for items that represents information about your infrastructure that is not tied to 
    a single node 
    example:
    =========
        a) users,
        b) groups,
        c) application release information
        d) passwords inside of a encrypted data bags 
2) These data bags takes JSON, so anything that you can do with JSON, can be done with data bags also .
3) So data bags again can be managed in two ways:
    a) we can create a data bag file on a local wrokstation machine in a data bags directory and then upload it
        to chef server
    b) second way of creating and managing the data bag using chef server API's with the custom scripts. We might 
        want to use this method if want to integrate the LDAP functionality using the RESTful API.
4) We could also encrypt our data bags with secrets. So we can actually go through and encrypt the data bag
    item and have each individual node decrypt it using the key.
